# LangExt4Sibilla

A repository where you can find VSCode Language Extensions for the languages that have been developed in Sibilla.

## Features

This repository has been thought to be as a container for VSCode Language Extensions for the languages that are currently available in Sibilla. 

These extensions can be used ONLY in VSCode. They are not available for other IDEs or editors yet

For each one, a Syntax Highlighter and a set of Snippets have been implemented to speed up the specification of a model.

The available extensions in the folder are the following:

 - [Population Models](https://github.com/quasylab/LangExt4Sibilla/tree/main/population-models)
 - [YODA](https://github.com/quasylab/LangExt4Sibilla/tree/main/yoda)
 
 ## How to use an Extension
 
 In order to use one of the available extensions, after you have downloaded the repository, these are the steps
 
 1. Copy the folder of the language extension you want use
 2. Go to `~/.vscode/extensions` (the folder .vscode may be hidden, toggle the visibility)
 3. Paste the folder
 4. Eventually, reload the VSCode editor window
 
 Now, you should be able to see that some keywords are coloured differently and if you start typing, a dropdown menu shows the available snippets
